            <p>With his lush and sensual visuals, pitch-perfect soundtracks, and soulful romanticism, Wong Kar Wai has established himself as one of the defining auteurs of contemporary cinema. Joined by such key collaborators as cinematographer Christopher Doyle; editor and production and costume designer William Chang Suk Ping; and actors Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung Man Yuk, Wong (or WKW, as he is often known) has written and directed films that have enraptured audiences and critics worldwide and inspired countless other filmmakers with their poetic moods and music, narrative and stylistic daring, and potent themes of alienation and memory. Whether tragically romantic, soaked in blood, or quirkily comedic, the films collected here are an invitation into the unique and wistful world of a deeply influential artist.

                Wong's films are a river, always moving, and a bit different every time you step into them. The longing for connection that may be reflected in that river when one views these movies in their youth feels more elegiac in middle age. What's fascinating about watching his work is how much they speak to each other. There are direct connections between certain films in that some actually serve as sequels (often more spiritual than literal) with the same actors and character names, but the tonal impact of collecting these movies is more powerful Each Wong Kar Wai film feels in conversation with the ones that came before it, and the power of this box set comes in feeling that process as each film makes the one that came before even richer.
